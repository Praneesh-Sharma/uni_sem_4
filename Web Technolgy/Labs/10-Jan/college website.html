                    <dt><b>C++ Fundamentals -</b></dt>
                    <dd>C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. 
                        C++ is a superset of the C language. A related programming language, Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program 
                        \objects in a network such as the Internet. Java is somewhat simpler and easier to learn than C++ and has characteristics that give it 
                        other advantages over C++. However, both languages require a considerable amount of study.

                    <dd>
                        Data Structure can be defined as the group of data elements which provides an efficient way of storing and organising data in the computer 
                        so that it can be used efficiently. Some examples of Data Structures are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc. Data Structures are widely 
                        used in almost every aspect of Computer Science i.e. Operating System, Compiler Design, Artifical intelligence, Graphics and many more.

                    <dd>
                        As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming, they use objects as a primary 
                        source to implement what is to happen in the code. Objects are seen by the viewer or user, performing tasks assigned by you. Object-oriented 
                        programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc. in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind 
                        together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

                    <dd>
                        Competition math is cherry-picked to use a specific knowledge base (which depends on the competition). A high school math contest uses math known 
                        to a high school student. The problem has been solved already by the people arranging the contest. The time required, if one thinks of the correct 
                        trick, is tailored to the contest too. There does tend to be a trick which makes the problem relatively easy if one thinks of it. Contests are full 
                        of what I would call “cute” problems. If you find math problems fun, old contests provide a big supply of fun problems. All of these are traits that 
                        could occur in mathematics naturally, but for a contest they occur because the people who arrange the contest search for problems like this.

                        The word Algorithm means ” A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations ” Or ” 
                        A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations”.

                        the branch of mathematics concerned with the analysis of strategies for dealing with competitive situations where the outcome of a participant's 
                        choice of action depends critically on the actions of other participants. Game theory has been applied to contexts in war, business, and biology.

                    <dd>
                        The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. 
                        Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm 
                        is running on.

                        Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm. The space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by 
                        the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.
